>>>Features

- Supports different tax slabs and calculation logic
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface
- Provides a breakdown of tax calculation
>> Requirements

>>Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/income-tax-calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd income-tax-calculator
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python income_tax_calculator.py
    ```
>>Usage
After running the script, the program will prompt you to enter the following details:
1. Your annual income
2. Applicable tax deductions (if any)

The program will then calculate the tax based on the current tax slabs and print the result along with a breakdown of the calculation.

>>> Example

```bash
Enter your annual income: 75000
Enter any applicable tax deductions (if none, enter 0): 5000

Your total taxable income: 70000
Total Tax Payable: 8500
```

## Tax Slabs (Example for Indian Tax System)
- Income up to ₹2,50,000: No tax
- Income from ₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000: 5%
- Income from ₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000: 20%
- Income above ₹10,00,000: 30%
